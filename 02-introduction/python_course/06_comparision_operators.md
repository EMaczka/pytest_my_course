# Section 6: Comparison Operators in Python

Comparison operators in Python allow you to compare values and determine the relationship between them. These operators
return Boolean values (`True` or `False`) based on whether the comparison is true or false. Let's explore the common
comparison operators:

## Equality (==)

The equality operator (`==`) checks if two values are equal. It returns `True` if they are and `False` otherwise. For
example:

```python
x = 5
y = 7

result = x == y  # 'result' is False because 5 is not equal to 7
```

## Inequality (!=)

The inequality operator (!=) checks if two values are not equal. It returns True if they are not equal and False if they
are equal. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 7

result = x != y  # 'result' is True because 5 is not equal to 7
```

## Greater Than (>)

The greater than operator (>) checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. It returns True if
the condition is met and False otherwise. For example:

```python
x = 7
y = 5

result = x > y  # 'result' is True because 7 is greater than 5
```

## Less Than (<)

The less than operator (<) checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. It returns True if the
condition is met and False otherwise. For example:

```python
x = 3
y = 6

result = x < y  # 'result' is True because 3 is less than 6
```

## Greater Than or Equal To (>=)

The greater than or equal to operator (>=) checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the
right. It returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 5

result = x >= y  # 'result' is True because 5 is greater than or equal to 5
```

## Less Than or Equal To (<=)

The less than or equal to operator (<=) checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
It returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise. For example:

```python
x = 4
y = 4

result = x <= y  # 'result' is True because 4 is less than or equal to 4
```

## Sumary

Comparison operators are essential for making decisions in your Python programs. They allow you to compare values and
control the flow of your code based on the results of these comparisons. Understanding how to use comparison operators
is a fundamental skill in programming.
