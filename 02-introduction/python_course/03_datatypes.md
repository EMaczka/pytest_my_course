# Section 3: Data Types in Python

In Python, data types determine the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated in a program. Python has several
built-in data types that are commonly used. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming. Here
are some of the most important data types in Python:

## int (Integer)

The `int` data type represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal point. For example:

```python
age = 30
quantity = -10
```

## float (Floating-Point)

The float data type represents numbers with a decimal point or in scientific notation. For example:

```python
pi = 3.14
price = 9.99
```

## str (String)

The str data type represents textual data, such as words, sentences, or characters. Strings are enclosed in single or
double quotes. For example:

```python
name = "Alice"
message = 'Hello, World!'
```

## bool (Boolean)

The bool data type represents Boolean values, which can be either True or False. These are often used for logical
operations and conditions. For example:

```python
is_valid = True
is_error = False
```

## list

The list data type is used to store a collection of items. Lists are ordered and mutable, which means you can change
their contents. For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## tuple

The tuple data type is similar to lists, but they are immutable, which means their contents cannot be changed after
creation. For example:

```python
coordinates = (3, 4)
names = ("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
```

## dict (Dictionary)

The dict data type represents key-value pairs. Each element in a dictionary has a unique key associated with it. For
example:

```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

## Sumary
These are some fundamental data types in Python. Understanding how to work with these types and knowing when to
use them is essential for writing effective Python code.
