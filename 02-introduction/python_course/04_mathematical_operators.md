# Section 4: Mathematical Operators in Python

Mathematical operators in Python are used to perform various arithmetic operations on numeric data. These operators
allow you to manipulate numbers, variables, and expressions to perform calculations. Here are some of the most commonly
used mathematical operators in Python:

## Addition (+)

The addition operator (`+`) is used to add two or more numbers together. For example:

```python
result = 5 + 3  # result is now 8
```

## Subtraction (-)

The subtraction operator (-) is used to subtract one number from another. For example:

```python
difference = 10 - 4  # difference is now 6
```

## Multiplication (*)

The multiplication operator (*) is used to multiply two or more numbers. For example:

```python
product = 6 * 7  # product is now 42
```

## Division (/)

The division operator (/) is used to divide one number by another. It results in a floating-point number, even if the
numbers are integers. For example:

```python
quotient = 20 / 4  # quotient is 5.0 (float)
```

## Floor Division (//)

The floor division operator (//) is used to divide one number by another and return the integer part of the result,
discarding any fractional part. For example:

```python
result = 20 // 3  # result is 6 (integer)
```

## Modulus (%)

The modulus operator (%) is used to find the remainder of the division between two numbers. For example:

```python
remainder = 17 % 4  # remainder is 1
```

## Exponentiation (**)

The exponentiation operator (**) is used to raise a number to a power. For example:

```python
result = 2 ** 3  # result is 8
```

## Sumary
These are the basic mathematical operators in Python. You can use parentheses () to control the order of operations,
just like in standard mathematics. Understanding how to use these operators is essential for performing calculations and
solving mathematical problems in Python.
