# Objectives
Set up automation environment.

**This course require local admin permissions in order to be able to install all needed components**

# Setup
Installed Python, PyCharm
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - please remember to add Python to PATH during installation by selecting appropriate checkbox
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) - please download Community Edition and after installation choose “Virtual Environment” as environment type when you open a project for the first time.

# Nice to have
* Python is indentation sensitive. for better formatting we can use combination **CTRL+ALT+L** so pycharm will format file for us
* For better visibility use 'Show Whitespaces' option in View -> Active Editor menu accessible on top left [Show Whitespaces](../11-screenshots/Show_whitespaces.png)

# Next task
