# Test Automation with pytest framework

## Purpose

The main purpose of this Fasttrack program is to gain skills and knowledge so that fasttrack participant is able to
design and implement UI test automation in Pytest Framework.

## Prerequisites

Fork this repository to be able to complete exersises.

**This course require local admin permissions in order to be able to install all needed components**

## Previous knowledge

Not required. Although some aspects of testing theory, especially concerning test scenarios/test cases and test
automation would be helpful.
Additionaly, for more theoretical you can check the following sources:

* [Basic Testing Theory](https://git.gft.com/testing-family-poland-fasttrack/testing_theory_foundation/-/blob/main/README.md)
* [Test Automation Simplification](https://techbeacon.com/5-ways-simplify-your-automated-test-cases)

## Assessment and review

To complete this fasttrack you should accomplish all **Objectives** from every chapter listed in **The skills** section.
You will do this by designing and implementing tests.
After completion of all chapters you will present all excersises to your mentor.

## The skills

While solving the tasks, you'll meet several general test automation related topics that you will learn. We assume (but
do not limit) that you should get familiar with such issues:
